       <h3>Scrape entries from KIT Open</h3>
       
       <p class="flow-text" style="text-align: justify">
        Our Scraper is Python code that uses the <i>Selenium web scraping library</i> to scrape 
        publications from the <a href="https://primo.bibliothek.kit.edu/primo-explore/search?tab=kit_evastar&sortby=date&vid=KIT" target="_blank">KIT Open website</a>.
        <br>
        The code navigates to the website, sets filters, and then scrapes the information for 
        each publication. It saves the scraped data in a CSV file, with the structure defined 
        in the "HEADER" variable. 
        <br><br>
        The code uses the <b>Chrome browser</b>, which can be run in headless mode (without the GUI) 
        if the "HEADLESS" variable is set to True. The <i>Chrome Driver and the Chrome browser 
        executable must be specified</i> in the "DRIVER_PATH" and "CHROME_PATH" variables, respectively.
        <br><br>
        The output file path is specified in the "OUTPUT_PATH" variable, and the number of 
        results to be scraped is defined in the "NUMBER_OF_RESULTS" variable.
        <br><br>
        In Google Chrome, there are several ways to <b>view the XPaths of elements</b> on a website.
        We recommend to just use the developer tools: You can open Chrome's developer tools by 
        clicking the "F12" button or by going to the browser menu and selecting "Developer" and 
        then "Developer tools". Then click on the "Elements" icon and select the element whose XPath
        you want to view. The XPath of the element will be displayed in the lower section of the
        developer tools.
